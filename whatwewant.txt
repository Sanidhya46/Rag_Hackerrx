Certainly! Based on the analysis of the provided PDFs and the structured questioning approach, here are example questions for each category along with sample answers, tailored to the content of the Cholamandalam MS General Insurance policy document:
1. Definition and Explanation Questions
Question: What does 'total loss' of checked-in baggage mean under this policy?
Answer Example: 'Total loss' of checked-in baggage refers to the complete and irreversible loss of the baggage, where the airline or carrier declares the baggage as lost or irrecoverable, as outlined in the endorsement no. 11A.
2. Coverage and Benefit-Related Questions
Question: Does the policy cover expenses for trip delay caused by airline strikes?
Answer Example: According to the policy, benefits related to trip delay are included, but specific exclusions such as losses caused by strikes are applicable. The policy specifies that delays caused by airline strikes are excluded unless otherwise mentioned, as per the special exclusions on page .
3. Claims Process and Procedure Questions
Question: What documents are needed to claim for the total loss of checked-in baggage?
Answer Example: To claim for the total loss of checked-in baggage, the insured must submit a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) obtained from the airline immediately upon discovering the loss, along with the completed claim form and any supporting documents.
4. Exclusion and Limitation Questions
Question: Are cosmetic treatments covered under the medical expenses benefit?
Answer Example: No, cosmetic treatments or plastic surgeries are excluded from coverage unless they are performed as part of treatment for injuries caused by an accident or burns, as specified in the exclusions on page .
5. Policy Conditions and Limitations Questions
Question: Is pre-existing illness covered under this insurance policy?
Answer Example: The policy specifies that pre-existing diseases are generally not covered unless explicitly stated. Specific conditions for coverage of pre-existing illnesses are detailed in the policy, and typically, such conditions are excluded from coverage.
6. Special Endorsements and Add-ons Questions
Question: Is the compassionate visit benefit automatically included in the main policy or optional?
Answer Example: The compassionate visit benefit is provided as an endorsement (Endorsement no. 8) and would require an active endorsement to be included. It is not part of the main policy coverage unless explicitly added.
7. Key Term Definition and Configuration Questions
Question: How is 'hospitalization' defined in this policy for the purposes of the emergency medical expenses benefit?
Answer Example: 'Hospitalization' refers to an admission to a hospital as an inpatient for a minimum period of 24 hours, with necessary documentation from the medical facility, as per the policy guidelines.
8. Scenario-Based or Comparative Questions
Question: If baggage is lost during a connecting flight, will the claim be covered?
Answer Example: Yes, if the baggage loss occurs during the transit on a trip covered by the policy and a Property Irregularity Report is obtained from the airline, the total loss benefit applies, subject to the policy terms.

training model ....using prompt methodology ...
✅ Part 1: Few-Shot Prompt Training Dataset (All 9 Types with Examples)
We create a list of training examples, each in "question-answer" format, based on your 9 categories:
1. Definition & Explanation
json
CopyEdit
{ "question": "How does the policy define a 'Hospital'?", "answer": "A hospital is any institution established for in-patient care and day care treatment of illness and/or injuries..."}
2. Coverage & Benefits
json
CopyEdit
{ "question": "Does this policy cover AYUSH treatments?", "answer": "Yes, AYUSH treatments are covered if the treatment is taken in a government hospital or any institution recognized by the government."}
3. Waiting Period & Eligibility
json
CopyEdit
{ "question": "What is the waiting period for cataract surgery?", "answer": "Cataract surgery has a waiting period of 24 months from the inception of the policy."}
4. Exclusions & Limits
json
CopyEdit
{ "question": "Are there sub-limits on ICU charges?", "answer": "Yes, ICU charges are limited to 2% of the sum insured per day for standard plans."}
5. Claim Process & Documentation
json
CopyEdit
{ "question": "What documents are needed to claim post-hospitalization expenses?", "answer": "You will need hospital discharge summary, doctor's prescription, original bills and receipts."}
6. Additional Benefits & Riders
json
CopyEdit
{ "question": "Does the policy offer a No Claim Discount?", "answer": "Yes, the No Claim Discount of up to 50% on the base premium is offered for each claim-free year."}
7. Policy Terms & Conditions
json
CopyEdit
{ "question": "What is the grace period for premium payment?", "answer": "The policy provides a 30-day grace period from the premium due date."}
8. Key Definitions
json
CopyEdit
{ "question": "What is considered inpatient treatment?", "answer": "Inpatient treatment means treatment for which the insured person has to stay in a hospital for more than 24 hours."}
9. Special Conditions
json
CopyEdit
{ "question": "What conditions apply for organ donor expenses?", "answer": "Organ donor expenses are covered only if the transplant is medically necessary and the organ is donated legally."}
You now have few-shot training data for in-context prompting.
✅ Part 2: LangChain Code – In-Context Few-Shot Prompt Template
Here’s how ybyou can create a prompt template with few-shot examples:
python
CopyEdit
from langchain.prompts.few_shot import FewShotPromptTemplate from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate  # Format for each example example_prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=["question", "answer"], template="Q: {question}\nA: {answer}\n" )  # Few-shot examples (from above) examples = [ {"question": "How does the policy define a 'Hospital'?", "answer": "A hospital is..."}, {"question": "Does this policy cover AYUSH treatments?", "answer": "Yes, AYUSH..."}, {"question": "What is the waiting period for cataract surgery?", "answer": "24 months..."}, {"question": "Are there sub-limits on ICU charges?", "answer": "Yes, ICU charges..."}, {"question": "What documents are needed to claim post-hospitalization expenses?", "answer": "Discharge summary..."}, {"question": "Does the policy offer a No Claim Discount?", "answer": "Yes, up to 50%..."}, {"question": "What is the grace period for premium payment?", "answer": "30 days..."}, {"question": "What is considered inpatient treatment?", "answer": "Treatment over 24 hours..."}, {"question": "What conditions apply for organ donor expenses?", "answer": "Covered if medically necessary..."} ]  # Combine examples into a full prompt prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate( examples=examples, example_prompt=example_prompt, prefix="The following are questions and answers about a health insurance policy:\n", suffix="Q: {input}\nA:", input_variables=["input"], )  final_prompt = prompt.format(input="Is maternity covered under this policy?") print(final_prompt)
✅ Part 3: Use with LLM + Vector Store (Pinecone/Retrieval)
Here's how to combine it with a vector store retriever (like Pinecone):
python
CopyEdit
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA from langchain.vectorstores import Pinecone from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceHub  # or OpenAI if needed# 1. Load your vector DB retriever = Pinecone.from_existing_index( index_name="your-pinecone-index", embedding=HuggingFaceEmbeddings() ).as_retriever()  # 2. Load your model llm = HuggingFaceHub(repo_id="google/flan-t5-base", model_kwargs={"temperature": 0.3})  # 3. Create RAG Chain with Prompt rag_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type( llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever, chain_type_kwargs={"prompt": prompt} )  # 4. Ask question response = rag_chain.run("Is there coverage for OPD expenses?") print(response)
